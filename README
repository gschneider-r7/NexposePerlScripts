This is a repository for perl scripts to run against Nexpose.  

Each directory contains an independent script.

Right now, there is only one script:

* GroupMaker - used to create groups of groups in Nexpose.  You can use this to create more complex groupings than Nexpose supports out of the box.
This script uses only the standard Perl library, so you should be able to download it and run it on any machine
with Perl installed.
